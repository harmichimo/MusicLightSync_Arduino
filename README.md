# MusicLightSync_Arduino
Description: Create a music-reactive LED strip with the Arduino and MSGEQ7

This was a fun side project I worked on before Christmas. After getting bored with the first few small projects in the Arduino starter book,
I decided to take on something a bit more challenging. This was my first Arduino project, however, I would only recommend this as a first project
to those who have a) some experience with circuit boards and b) some C++ coding knowledge.

If you have any questions while working on your own LED project, feel free to reach out to me.

Here is the project in action: https://youtu.be/y5W4rdrjQ8U
